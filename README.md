# Endometriosis-Awareness-Month-2022

2022 reminder presentation, presented from April 2022.

The month of March is the month of endometriosis awareness, however, this disease does not magically disappear on April 1 each year. 

Knowledge of a disease that affects such a large part of our population, claiming so much harm, should be spread throughout the year.
